# Getting Started with Court Case UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is built to be a more usable method of aggregating eviction court cases by landlords

The production application can be found [here](https://opennebraska.github.io/court-case-ui/).
It uses Github Pages for hosting. It will be automatically redeployed on any commit to the main branch.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Calendar View

The calendar view is [react-big-calendar](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html).  It was selected as an easy way to bootstrap the viewing of all court cases by dates.  It has a number of helpful APIs that we use.
Here is the [Demo and Docs](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html#prop-selected)


## Material UI
We selected [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) to help with the component and styling.  We had the most experience with that library.
